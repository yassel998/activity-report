Development of a web application for activity reports (CRA), with a feature to record working days. Weekends and holidays are automatically excluded, thanks to the use of the api.gouv.fr API. The app also allows an administrator to manage employees and projects


Note: I am currently working on a better version of this application, transitioning from JavaScript to TypeScript to practice and familiarize myself with TypeScript for the first time. My goals for this new version include writing cleaner code and enhancing security by integrating JWT tokens. Additionally, I aim to improve the application's overall user experience and interface:

JWT Token Integration: Implementing secure authentication mechanisms.
Enhanced UI/UX: Focusing on a more intuitive and visually appealing design.
